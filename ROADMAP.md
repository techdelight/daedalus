# Roadmap

## Backlog

| # | Item |
|---|------|
| ~~30~~ | ~~Skill install path — install skills to `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` (directory per skill) instead of flat `.claude/skills/{skill-name}.md`~~ |
| 31 | Rename skill store — rename "skill catalog" / "skill" terminology to avoid confusion with Claude Code's built-in skill repository. Candidate: "focus" (focus catalog, focus files). Open to alternatives |
| ~~1~~ | ~~Agent mode (`--agent`) — start Claude Code as a specific agent by passing a named agent configuration, enabling purpose-built personas and tool sets per project~~ |
| ~~2~~ | ~~Authentication for Web UI — add token-based login to protect the dashboard when exposed on a network~~ |
| ~~3~~ | ~~Session cookie with configurable expiry~~ |
| ~~4~~ | ~~`--auth` / `--no-auth` flag for `daedalus web` (default: auth enabled)~~ |
| ~~5~~ | ~~Generate and display access token on first `daedalus web` launch~~ |
| 6 | Shell toggle — switch between Claude Code and a regular project shell inside the container |
| ~~7~~ | ~~Switch target for existing project — change build target from TUI (e.g. `F3`) and CLI (`daedalus config <name> --set target=<stage>`) without re-registering~~ |
| 8 | Bundle release assets — package runtime files into a single tarball on the GitHub Release page instead of individual files |
| 9 | Side-by-side versions — install a new version alongside the existing one, allowing rollback or A/B comparison before switching |
| ~~10~~ | ~~Shared skills/MCP repository — a central directory of skills and MCP server configs that can be mounted or linked into any project, avoiding per-project duplication~~ |
| 11 | Homebrew installation (`brew install daedalus`) — add Homebrew tap, formula generator, and CI automation. See [docs/homebrew-plan.md](docs/homebrew-plan.md) for full plan |
| ~~12~~ | ~~WSL2 Web UI access — enable `daedalus web` to be reachable from the Windows host when running inside WSL2 (bind to `0.0.0.0` or WSL2 IP, port-forwarding guidance, auto-detect WSL2 environment)~~ |
| ~~13~~ | ~~Project management view in Web UI — per-project dashboard showing vision, version, time spent, and percentage complete~~ |
| ~~14~~ | ~~Project management MCP server — provide an MCP server inside each project container so Claude Code can report progress (vision, version, percentage complete, time spent) back to Daedalus~~ |
| ~~15~~ | ~~Skill catalog — a browsable catalog of available skills that projects can select from and mount into their containers~~ |
| 16 | ACP integration — use the Agent Client Protocol to communicate with the Claude Code CLI, enabling Daedalus to observe agent state (thinking, tool use, idle, error) in real time |
| ~~17~~ | ~~Roadmap in Web UI — display the project roadmap as a collapsible side panel on the right of the dashboard~~ |
| ~~18~~ | ~~Daedalus as MCP client — have Daedalus consume the Project Management MCP server to read roadmaps, construct and manage sprints, and trigger the agent to execute sprint items~~ |
| ~~19~~ | ~~GitHub repo projects — start a project from a GitHub repo URL, cloning into a default project root directory~~ |
| ~~20~~ | ~~Browser tab title — set the Web UI tab title to include the name of the active project~~ |
| 21 | Shared Maven `.m2` repository — mount a host-side `.m2/repository` into containers so dependencies are shared across projects. Investigate overlay/merge strategy: a stable global repo (read-only base) combined with a per-container local repo for builds/downloads/installs, so containers benefit from cached artifacts without polluting the shared cache |
| ~~22~~ | ~~Favicon — add a Daedalus favicon to the Web UI so the browser tab shows a recognizable icon~~ |
| ~~23~~ | ~~Display sharing (`--display`) — forward the host X11/Wayland display into Docker containers so GUI applications can render on the host screen. Support WSL2 (via `DISPLAY` + `/tmp/.X11-unix` or Wayland socket) and native Linux. Stored as a per-project `display` flag in `projects.json`, off by default. Prompted during `daedalus <name> <dir>` first registration and configurable via `daedalus config <name> --set display=true`~~ |
| ~~24~~ | ~~Copilot CLI support — add GitHub Copilot CLI as an alternative coding agent alongside Claude Code. Allow selecting the agent per project via `--agent copilot` or `daedalus config <name> --set agent=copilot`. Install Copilot CLI in the container, configure entrypoint to launch the selected agent, and adapt session management for Copilot's CLI interface~~ |
| 25 | Webdev container — move Node.js out of the regular `dev` stage into a dedicated `webdev` build target for web/frontend projects. Keeps the default dev image lean |
| ~~26~~ | ~~Mobile-friendly web UI — scrollable terminal output (replace tmux Ctrl+B PgUp/PgDown with native scroll), multi-line input (Enter inserts newline, separate submit button/shortcut), simplified project overview (name, online status, attach/kill/start action buttons)~~ |
| 27 | Decouple tooling from agent runner images — keep base agent containers minimal and let the agent install additional tools at runtime. Provide container snapshotting so customized environments persist across restarts. Key challenge: when the base image is upgraded, how do we replay tool installations? Options: (a) maintain a declarative tool registry (tool name + version + install method) that a provisioner re-applies on new base images — portable but subjective per tool; (b) record raw install commands as a replayable script — simple but fragile across base image changes; (c) hybrid approach with a registry of well-known tools (apt, pip, npm) plus an escape hatch for arbitrary commands. Needs design spike to evaluate trade-offs |
| ~~28~~ | ~~Active project filter — add a toggle/filter to the Web UI and TUI that shows only running projects. Useful when the project list grows large and the user wants to focus on what is currently active~~ |
| 29 | Mobile WebSocket stability — investigate and fix regular disconnects on mobile web clients (possible causes: browser background tab throttling, network switches between Wi-Fi and cellular, WebSocket ping/pong timeout tuning, reconnect logic) |
| ~~32~~ | ~~Foreman UI project navigation — clicking a project in the Foreman web UI opens that project's detail view~~ |
| 33 | tmux control mode integration — use `tmux -C` control mode instead of raw PTY for terminal interaction. Enables native scrollback access (replacing tmux keybind-based scrolling), clean session disconnect/reconnect, and machine-parseable event notifications for agent observability |
| 34 | Project detail roadmap not found — when viewing project details the roadmap panel shows "not found" even though vision loads correctly. Investigate roadmap file detection / API endpoint for the project detail view |
| ~~35~~ | ~~History mode visual indicator — when the user presses `history` (scroll mode) inside a project terminal, there is no visual feedback that scroll mode is active. Add a clear indicator (e.g. status bar highlight, overlay badge, or border change) so the user knows they are in history/scroll mode~~ |
| ~~36~~ | ~~History mode exit — provide a clear, discoverable way to exit history/scroll mode and document it. Consider an on-screen hint (e.g. "Press Esc to exit history") shown while in scroll mode~~ |
| 37 | Shared Claude versions volume — Claude CLI stores its versions in `~/.local/share/claude/versions` inside each container, consuming significant disk space per project. Create a shared Docker volume for this path and mount it into all containers that use a Claude runner, so versions are downloaded once and reused across projects |
| 38 | Web UI hangs on trust prompt — when attaching to a container/tmux session where Claude CLI is showing the "trust this folder" security prompt, the Web UI hangs instead of rendering the prompt interactively. Investigate whether the trust prompt can be auto-accepted via CLI flags (e.g. pre-trusting the project directory) or ensure the prompt is rendered and interactive in the web terminal |
| 39 | Add Maven to dev container — the `dev` build target does not include `mvn`. Install Maven via SDKMAN! in the Dockerfile so Java/Maven projects work out of the box |
| ~~40~~ | ~~TUI scroll recovery after history crash — when using `history` (scroll mode) in the Web UI and the session crashes, the TUI can fail to re-orient tmux to the bottom of the scrollback. Ensure the TUI resets the tmux viewport to the latest output after a crash or abnormal exit from scroll mode~~ |
| ~~41~~ | ~~Foreman roadmap display — the Foreman view does not show roadmaps when opening them for a project. Investigate whether the Foreman is failing to read/parse the roadmap or if the UI is not rendering the response~~ |
| ~~42~~ | ~~Web UI blank terminal on attach — when opening a project in the Web UI the terminal view frequently shows no content, especially on mobile. Investigate causes: WebSocket race condition on connect, control mode attach timing, initial pane capture missing, or mobile browser throttling delaying the first render~~ |

## Current Sprint

### Sprint 37: History Mode UX & Bug Fixes (v0.33.0)

Goal: make history/scroll mode in the Web UI discoverable, clearly indicated, and easy to exit. Add crash/disconnect recovery so the terminal viewport always returns to live output. Fix Foreman roadmap display and blank terminal on attach.

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | `inHistoryMode` state tracking in `terminal.js` with `enterHistoryMode()` / `exitHistoryMode()` functions | Done |
| 2 | Visual banner (`#history-banner`) with "HISTORY MODE" label, hint text, and Exit button in `index.html` + `style.css` | Done |
| 3 | Exit via Esc key, any keystroke, or Exit button — sends `live-capture` to restore live viewport | Done |
| 4 | `CaptureVisible()` method on `ControlSession` and `live-capture` WebSocket message handler in `web.go` | Done |
| 5 | History mode state reset on WebSocket close, error, and `disconnectTerminal()` | Done |
| 6 | Foreman roadmap display — `showDashboard()` now resets roadmap panel and auto-loads via `loadRoadmap()`. Roadmap visible immediately when opening a project from Foreman or project list (backlog #41) | Done |
| 7 | Web UI blank terminal on attach — `ws.onopen` now sends `live-capture` request after resize to populate terminal immediately on connect (backlog #42) | Done |

### Sprint 36: tmux Control Mode — Web Terminal Relay (v0.32.0)

Goal: wire the ControlSession into the Web UI terminal as an alternative to the PTY relay. Add scrollback request support via WebSocket. Both modes coexist — control mode activates via `?mode=control` query parameter.

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | `internal/web/web.go` — `handleTerminalControl()` handler using `ControlSession` instead of PTY, with `readControlMessages` / `writeControlMessages` relay goroutines | Done |
| 2 | WebSocket scrollback — client sends `{"type":"scrollback","lines":N}`, server calls `CapturePane()` and returns `{"type":"scrollback-response","content":"..."}` | Done |
| 3 | `internal/web/static/terminal.js` — add scrollback request message type and render response | Done |
| 4 | Tests and documentation | Done |

### Sprint 35: tmux Control Mode — Control Session & Parser (v0.31.0)

Goal: implement the control session package and message parser (Phase 1 of the tmux control mode plan). New `ControlSession` type that spawns `tmux -C attach-session`, parses `%output/%begin/%end/%error` messages, and provides `SendKeys()`, `CapturePane()`, and `ResizeWindow()` methods.

| 6 | Documentation — update ARCHITECTURE.md, CHANGELOG.md, VERSION, README.md | Done |

### Sprint 22: Runner/Persona Polish & Skill Fix (v0.17.0)

Goal: clean up the runner/persona split — add `daedalus runners` subcommand, separate `personas list` from runners, store persona details in companion `.md` files, fix skill installation path, and harden validation and test coverage.

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | `daedalus runners` subcommand — list and show built-in runner profiles with shell completions | Done |
| 2 | `personas list` shows only user-defined personas, `personas show` rejects built-in names | Done |

## Open Code Review Issues

| # | Issue | Severity | Sprint |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| ~~26~~ | ~~`claude /login` replaces `.credentials.json` (new inode), breaking bind-mount into running containers~~ | ~~Major~~ | Closed (credentials no longer bind-mounted) |
